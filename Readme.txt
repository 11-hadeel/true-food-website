### Promoting healthy eating through a digital platform is an innovative way to connect with a growing audience focused on health. This report details the customization and enhancement of the "True Food" restaurant website, tailored to align with the restaurant's branding and health-conscious mission. The website is designed to connect with customers through an engaging user interface that includes dynamic visuals, comprehensive dietary information, and seamless functionality. By utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap framework, we customized an existing template to create a responsive and visually appealing platform. The PHP scripts, already integrated within the template, enhance interactivity by managing customer inquiries and reservations.
